Please read LICENSE file for COPYING information.

This software syncs with the ports PR gnats database on FreeBSD.org and parses the files, and keeps summary information in an SQLite3 database.

Requirements:

Tested with perl 5.16.2, may work with other versions.

DBI
DBD::SQLite
Time::Piece
Sys::Syslog

*comment out the syslog call if you don't want it logging to syslog.


Programs:

(.) parse-gnats-ports.pl

	This program scans the ports directory and updates the SQLite3 database.
	It reports the number of updated PR in the syslog, but only if
	there are any.
	Note that warnings are disabled, the strptime() function in Perl can be 
	a bit finicky, and we are dealing with thousands of reports from many 
	different users with many different email clients. For the most part 
	the different cases are handled but there are still a few random 
	complaints coming out of strptime(); If you are hacking on the code 
	or having some problems you might like to comment out the line at 
	the top to get warnings back for debug purposes, etc.
	The newest file timestamp is stored in '/var/db/lastrun.txt'. 
	If the program cannot read the file, or the value is zero, it will 
	re-parse all the files and update or re-create the DB.
	This can take 10-20 minutes or longer, depending on your hardware.
	Otherwise an update should go pretty quick.
	I am testing with 0-59/10 in cron, or every 10 minutes, and it seems to
	work pretty good.

(.) sync-gnats-ports.pl

	This program can be run from cron, or from the command line. 
	It will terminate if the file /tmp/pr-up-running exists, to avoid 
	the possibility of multiple processes wrecking your system. In the 
	event of a power loss, or reboot, it is advised to add the line 
	'rm -f /tmp/pr-up-running' to your rc.local.
